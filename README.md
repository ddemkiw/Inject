=======================

## Synopsis

Rewriting the inject method for Array class

## Technologies Used

- RUBY
- RSPEC

## Context

Week 3 Challenge (Test) at Makers Academy


## Reflections

This project opened my eyes to what is going on behind the Ruby Curtain. It also opened my eyes to the wild and wonderful world of recursion. The good news: I truly, understand Ruby's inject method. The bad news: I feel as if I have forgotten about all other ruby methods. I find myself trying to use .inject in all sorts of situations, even those where it absolutely does note apply. I'm sure this is a predictable and temporary effect of working so closely and intensely with one method for a few days.
